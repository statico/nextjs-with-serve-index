# Next.js with directory listing test

## How to use

Download the example or clone this repo.

Install it and run:

```bash
yarn install
yarn run dev
```

## The idea behind the example

The [serve-index](https://github.com/expressjs/serve-index) module is useful for showing a simple directory index in an Express server. This example attempts to make it work with [Next.js](https://github.com/zeit/next.js).
